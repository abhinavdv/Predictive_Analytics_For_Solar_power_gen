# Predictive_Analytics_For_Solar_power_gen

IoT applications involve processing heterogeneous near real time data. These heterogeneous data streams often form complex patterns in real-time. These complex patterns need to be understood to be able to make informed decisions in real-time. This brings in the use of CEP(Complex event processing) which takes care of processing, analysing and inferring from these complex patterns in near-real time. But the problem with this approach is that it is reactive and it does not exploit historical data. Exploiting historical data enables us to make predictions. Making predictions enables us to estimate key parameters beforehand which is essential in many mission critical applications. One such algorithm which helps us estimate predictions from real-time data is the Adaptive moving window regression (AMWR) which makes sure that the historical data is processed to give a more adaptive solution which can predict future instances with good accuracy levels. The aim is to enhance this algorithm and/or devise a similar algorithm and apply it to other real-time use cases and validate the working of the new algorithm.
